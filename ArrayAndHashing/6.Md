You're on the right track! You're implementing a function to **group anagrams** by manually checking pairs and avoiding duplicates — nice job. However, I’ll give you a full breakdown of what’s **good**, what can be **improved**, and how to make it **more efficient**.

---

## ✅ What’s Good in Your Code

* ✅ You're using `slices.Contains` to track and skip already grouped items — good practice.
* ✅ `isAnagram` works correctly using sorted slices of strings.
* ✅ You handled edge cases like empty or one-element input.
* ✅ The logic is clear and readable.

## 🔍 Room for Improvement

### 1. **Performance (Inefficient Time Complexity)**

You're using nested loops with a per-comparison cost of `O(n log n)` due to sorting in `isAnagram`. That makes the total time complexity **O(n² \* k log k)**, where `n` = number of strings, and `k` = average length of a string.

This works for small inputs but **won’t scale well** for large lists.

---

### 2. **Tracking Visited Indices is Error-Prone**

Using a slice to track `alreadyVisited` and checking with `slices.Contains()` is **O(n)** per lookup. That means overall complexity increases further.

#### ✅ Alternative:

Use a `map[int]bool` for constant-time lookup:

```go
visited := make(map[int]bool)
visited[i] = true
if visited[j] { ... }
```

---

### 3. **Redundant `if slices.Equal(...) { return true }`**

This:

```go
if slices.Equal(t1, t2) {
    return true
}
return false
```

can be shortened to:

```go
return slices.Equal(t1, t2)
```

## ✅ Suggested Optimized Version (Using Map for Grouping)

Instead of pairwise comparison, group by sorted key:

```go
import (
    "sort"
    "strings"
)

func groupAnagrams(strs []string) [][]string {
    groups := make(map[string][]string)

    for _, word := range strs {
        chars := strings.Split(word, "")
        sort.Strings(chars)
        key := strings.Join(chars, "")
        groups[key] = append(groups[key], word)
    }

    result := [][]string{}
    for _, group := range groups {
        result = append(result, group)
    }

    return result
}
```

### 🔥 Why this is better:

| Feature                    | Benefit                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Uses a map with sorted key | No duplicate checking needed                 |
| No nested loop             | Time complexity drops to **O(n \* k log k)** |
| Easy to read and idiomatic | Aligns with Go best practices                |

## 🧪 Example Output

Input:

```go
[]string{"eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"}
```

Output:

```go
[["eat" "tea" "ate"] ["tan" "nat"] ["bat"]]
```

## ✅ Summary

| What You Did                         | What to Consider            |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Custom pairwise grouping             | Works, but not optimal      |
| `slices.Contains` + `alreadyVisited` | Good logic, but slow        |
| Sorting + map as key                 | Fast and scalable           |
| Using `map[int]bool` for visited     | More efficient than a slice |
